# IleRise - AgroData Explorer
## NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 - Project Description

---

## üåç What does IleRise do and how does it work?

**IleRise** is an innovative educational farming simulation game that empowers farmers and students in Benin to make data-driven agricultural decisions using real NASA Earth observation data.

### How it works:

1. **Location-Based Data Loading**
   - Players select their region in Benin on an interactive satellite map
   - The system fetches real-time NASA data (NDVI, soil moisture, temperature, precipitation) specific to that location
   - Data comes from multiple NASA satellites: MODIS (temperature/NDVI), SMAP (soil moisture), GPM (precipitation)

2. **Two Game Modes**

   **A) Simulation Mode**
   - Players adjust agricultural parameters (irrigation, NPK fertilizer, organic matter, pest control)
   - A physics-based simulation engine models crop growth over 60-365 days
   - The simulation incorporates real NASA data to create realistic environmental conditions
   - Players must reach target yields while managing resources efficiently
   - Provides immediate visual feedback through 3D field visualization using Three.js

   **B) Interactive Farm Mode**
   - Real-time farm management with multiple plots
   - Players perform actions: plowing, planting, watering, fertilizing, weeding, harvesting
   - Dynamic time simulation with day/night cycles and seasonal changes
   - Livestock management system (chickens for eggs and organic fertilizer)
   - Market system for buying/selling agricultural products
   - Progressive difficulty with plot unlocking and resource constraints

3. **NASA-Powered Recommendations**
   - Real-time analysis of field conditions based on satellite data
   - Intelligent suggestions for irrigation, fertilization, and pest management
   - Educational cards explaining NASA data sources and agricultural best practices
   - NDVI-based health monitoring to detect crop stress early

4. **Educational System**
   - Interactive knowledge cards covering water management, NPK nutrients, soil health, crop rotation, and NASA satellites
   - Quiz system to reinforce learning
   - Competency tracking across 5 key skills: NASA data analysis, resource management, decision-making, agricultural diagnosis, and planning
   - Gamified progression with achievements, stars, and coins
